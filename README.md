# AUTODUNGEON

Hey! I am a computer engineering student and I am wanting some challenge in my learning, as my basic C course is boring me. I came up with the concept for AUTODUNGEON to remedy this!

### Goals
- [ ] Spawn rooms, items, and weapons
- [ ] Make NPCs that will help you
- [ ] Create a fighting system
  
### Wishes
- [ ] Map system

I hope you have fun taking a look around my little project!
